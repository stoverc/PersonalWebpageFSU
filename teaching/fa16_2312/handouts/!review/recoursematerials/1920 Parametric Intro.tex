In 10.1-10.2 we're going to discuss \textbf{parametric curves}. Curves are defined parametrically when $x$ and $y$ are functions of a third variable, $t$, called a \textbf{parameter}. When plotting parametric curves, both $x$ and $y$ depend on $t$. Start by making a table of values with three columns $t$, $x$, and $y$. $t$ is the independent variable, determine $x$ and $y$ then plot the points. Turn in for 4 board work points.

\begin{enumerate} 

\item A curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations $x=t, y=t^2$.  Sketch a graph of the curve from $-3 \leq t \leq 3$ by plotting at least 7 points.  \\

\item A curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations $x=\cos t, y=\sin t$.  Sketch a graph of the curve from $-\pi \leq t \leq \pi$ by plotting at least 8 points.  \\

\item A curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations $x=\cos t, y=\sin 3t$.  Sketch a graph of the curve from $-\pi \leq t \leq \pi$ by plotting at least 8 points.  \\

\item A curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations $x=t^3-3t, y=t^2-3$.  Sketch a graph of the curve from $-3 \leq t \leq 3$ by plotting at least 8 points.  \\
