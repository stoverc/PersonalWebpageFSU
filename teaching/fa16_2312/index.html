						<p>Hello, all! I hope this finds you well!</p>

						<p>I had a small handful of you ask me at some point today whether you should drop the class, how the final is going to affect things, etc. The purpose of this announcement is to (hopefully) bring you some clarity.</p>

						<p>First, so you know: <b>Tomorrow is midterm, so it's the last day to drop the course without incurring some sort of penalty.</b></p>

						<p>So, what you should know when deciding whether to drop the course:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Right now, you've only had 2 of the 4 exams + final and each exam is worth 1/7 of your grade. That means that if we had zero more home works (which isn't the case), <b>you still have 4/7 of your grade to be determined!</b><br><br>

							To put that in numbers terms: If you had a 0% average at this point in the semester (which no one has), if we had no more homeworks (which won't happen), and if you got 100% on everything else, you'd still have 57.1% for the course! In particular: If you average 50% on the first two exams and get 100% on everything else, you'll have a C-.<br><br>

							Right now, anything is possible, so don't rush to drop.<br><br>

							Having said that:</li>

							<li>Making 100% (or 90%, or 80%...) is going to be difficult moving forward if you're in the 30%-55% range thus far. As you've seen, things tend to build, so struggling now means probably struggling later; keep that in mind.<br><br>

							Also keep in mind that the 4th exam + a solid half-ish of the final will be on sequences and series (aka, the topics most Calc 2 students struggle with most). If you're having a hard time now, you're not going to randomly have an easy time. You're going to have to work on it a lot. Like a lot a lot.<br><br>

							If you're someone who's got a super-full load, a bunch of difficult classes, >= 1 job that eats a lot of your time, a whole bunch of family/home responsibilities, etc., you <b>will</b> struggle to make the time needed to double your scores moving forward. Also: If you're struggling <b>now</b> to find time for this class <b>and</b> you need a considerable turn-around to get the grade you want at the end of the final, it's almost assured that you're not in a good situation and you may want to consider dropping.</li>

							<li>There may also be penalties for falling below full-time, etc. etc., so make sure you understand the repercussions of dropping (or not).</li>
						</ol>

						<p>As always, feel free to email me with questions you may have!</p>

						<p>Have a great weekend, everyone, and thanks so much for a good half-semester thus far!</p>

						<p>Hello all!</p>

						<p>If you weren't in class yesterday, you missed a couple things:</p>

							<li>We finished section 7.8 with the study of the comparison test.

							<li>I gave two handouts in class: One is an example of approximate integration problems you should know how to do for your test (the date of which is still not 100% clear) and the other is HW2. You can get these from the course webpage, under the Handouts/Homework tabs, respectively.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Just a reminder: <b>HW2 is due on Monday, October 10.</b> I've added that to the calendar.</p>

						<p>Hello, all,</p>

						<p><b>Re: Office Hours: </b>I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but because of some errands I have to run, I won't be able to hold my usual Friday office hours today. As always, please feel free to email with questions and/or to ask for help over on the Slack channel!</p>

						<p><b>Reminder: </b>On Sunday we'll have our homework/exam review study session in our usual classroom. <i>You'll want to enter Love building through the doors at the west side of the building, facing the Colllins research lab / the giant tanks of Liquid Nitrogen, etc.</i> I'll try to prop open other doors as well, but I can't guarantee my ability to do so.</p>

						<p><b>Announcements about Homework: </b></p>
						<ol>
							<li>After talking to some of you last night, I realized that the homework has been causing you a lot of grief. Don't fret about the homework too much, guys: The homework is designed so that you show me what you <i>do</i> know, not what you don't. What does that mean? It means that you should do as much of each problem as you can without worrying about penalties for not completing problems: You get a lot out of doing the steps of the problems, and genuinely, getting the full answers isn't as important as going through the process.<br><br>

							The goal moving forward should be to prepare for your exam! Remember: Exams count way more than homework anyway, and I plan to be extremely accommodating on the homework front! So: <b>Use the homework as an exam study tool. </b> The answers to homework problems are far less meaningful than understanding the techniques you are/should use!</li>
							<li>There's a typo in #4, part (a), question (i): The integrand should have $\sec^2(\theta)$ and <i>not</i> $\sec^3(\theta)$.</b> With this revision and the hint, you should be able to solve it super-easily!<br><br>

							I especially want to commend those of you who stayed late last night to try to work out the typo'd version! We found out that it was likely an exercise in futility in and of itself, but what we also learned was there were lots of good techniques within that futility which helps prepare for your exam! I'm sorry I didn't catch the typo sooner!</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Talk to you guys soon!</p>

						<p>I have a few announcements:</p>

							<li>There's a small collection of you for whom neither of the selected days/times will work; you should be on the look-out for emails, because I'll be making contact asap.</li>

							<li>There's a typo in the first problem of HW 1. It says to use <b>the chain rule</b> to get to the integration by parts formula; it should say to use <b>the product rule</b> to do so, and basically what it's looking for is a write-up of the proof we did in class. It's also done in your textbook as well. <b>You should definitely make yourself familiar with this, because it's fundamentally important.</b></li>
						</ol>

						<p>Tentatively, I'm also going to try to work on a short handout that rectifies the typo in today's last example + (hopefully) makes trig substitution a little more palatable. I'll email again if/when that materializes.</p>

						<p>$\circ$ <b>Geometric series</b>: The indices for geometric series can be written as either $\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n$ or as $\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1}$.</p>
						<p>$\circ$ <b>Convergence</b>: Note that convergence is a statement about the <i>eventual</i> behavior of the series. In particular, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges if and only if $\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n$ converges for all finite integers $N\geq 1$. This will be important in subsequent sections.</p>
