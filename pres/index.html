				<div class="abstract">The aim of this talk is to discuss Curt McMullen's <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">lim</span> software, a tool which allows users to visualize the limiting behavior of iterated M&ouml;bius transformations. Overall, the talk will be broken into (roughly) three parts: First, there will be a (generally self-contained) review of the necessary mathematical background; next, the softwar itself will be discussed with special emphasis on what's happening "behind the scenes"; finally and as time permits, there will be a discussion regarding some <i>limitations</i> (get it?!) and possible generalizations of the software.

				<p>The talk will be accessible to anyone with undergraduate exposure to complex analysis and elementary group theory and will contain a diverse enough collection of information to appeal to those interested in either math or computer science. Everyone is welcome.</p></div>

				<span class = "abstract_link">Description</span>
				<div class="abstract">This will be an introductory talk centered on notions related to finite-depth foliations on 3-manifolds. In this talk, the term "depth" will be defined relative to foliations and numerous examples will be given to help illustrate the concept. In addition, an introduction to sutured manifolds will be given including their decompositions and hierarchies thereof. The talk will conclude with a short summary of results contained in the seminal work of Gabai, one of which includes an algorithm for constructing finite-depth foliations on certain classes of sutured 3-manifolds. Overall, the talk will be very low-level and will feature lots of pictures.</div>

This relatively new and blossoming field has proven to be of particular interest in recent years, both with pure mathematicians and theoretical physicists alike. Overall, the talk will contain some brief overview-type results about the general setup of Hitchin's geometry including basic facts, preliminary results (largely without proof), and some discussion about how these ideas generalize the usual differential geometry. Included will be ideas about generalized complex geometry, and it will be shown (in various depths) how results from the geometry of complex manifolds can be generalized to this new setting. As time permits, some ideas about future ideas and additional research thereon may be discussed.</div>
