# My FSU Personal Webpage
This is the entire backend of my personal FSU math homepage, located [here](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~cstover).

Nothing has been done with this site in quite some time, so having it as a GitHub repo _may_ prompt me to update it and/or give it a facelift, make it more response, use more Javascript, etc....

...emphasis on _may_.

## Changelog
### 21 Jun 2022
1. Initial commit. 
2. Later, removed the .nb files to de-clutter the repo. Yes, I have backups.
